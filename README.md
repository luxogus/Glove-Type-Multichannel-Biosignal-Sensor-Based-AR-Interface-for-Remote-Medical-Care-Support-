## Abstract 

Real time bio signal visualization, AR visualization, Telemedicine 

Biological signals such as EMG, ECG, and EEG are measured non-invasively from the skin surface, making them safer and more accessible than invasive systems. However, their accessibility is limited for non-specialists due to the need for specialized knowledge regarding electrode placement and signal interpretation. To overcome these limitations, this study developed a glove-type electrode system that allows even beginners to easily acquire biosignals. This system was integrated with a HoloLens2-based AR platform to track hand movements in real-time. This enabled the visualization of virtual electrodes, providing an intuitive and user-friendly signal interpretation environment. 


## Introduction 

The human body generates weak electrical signals from human activity such as brain activity, heart beats and muscles activity. These electrical signals are commonly called biosignal and categorized as electromyography (EMG) for muscle activity, electrocardiography (ECG) for cardiac activity, and electroencephalography (EEG) for brain activity. Biosignal can be measured noninvasively by attaching surface electrodes to the skin for measuring electrical potential. Compared to invasive systems which need to remove skin and bone, noninvasive surface measurements are safer and far more accessible.  

Despite to these usable advantages, practical use by laypersons remains difficult because accurate electrode placement, noise mitigation. Also signal processing and interpreting which require specialized expertise hinds personalization across individuals. 

To address this gap, this study develop a system that enables non-expert users to acquire biosignals easily. This study introduce a glove-type electrode system that measures signals simply by bringing the gloved hand into contact with the skin instead of fixed small area. Our electrode have octopus sucker shaped supporter to maintain skin-electrode interface even if measure target moves a lot. The system provides real-time, color-coded visualization of signal strength based on amplitude root mean sqaure(RMS), allowing users to intuitively understand the bio activity without interpret waveform complexity. Also, this visualization is overlaid with user's hand in AR display. Through connecting real and virtual world in AR, user can easily identify quality of skin-electrode contact and understand bio signal in spatial level. 

## Research Purpose 

The primary objective of this study is to establish a novel biosignal measurement platform that enhances usability, stability, and interpretability for both experts and non-experts. 

First, we aimed to design and fabricate a glove-type electrode system that allows for effortless attachment to the skin. In addition to a baseline electrode configuration, we explored an octopus-inspired suction hardware as an optional module to further improve adhesion and contact stability under dynamic conditions. This dual-track approach allows comparative evaluation of conventional glove electrodes and suction-enhanced electrodes, broadening potential applications depending on the measurement environment. 

Second, this work seeks to develop a real-time augmented reality (AR) visualization framework using Hololens2. By accurately aligning a virtual electrode array with the electrode configuration embedded in the glove, the system enables intuitive spatial mapping of biosignal origins. Such real-time visualization facilitates immediate interpretation of signal distribution without requiring specialized knowledge of electrode placement. 

Third, we pursued the implementation of an intuitive software user interface that simplifies the process of biosignal acquisition and interpretation for beginners. By providing a streamlined presentation of signal characteristics, the platform lowers the entry barrier for first-time users and supports practical applications in remote diagnostics and personalized healthcare. 

Together, these objectives converge toward the development of an accessible and reliable biosignal measurement system that bridges the gap between advanced biomedical instrumentation and everyday clinical or telemedical use.
